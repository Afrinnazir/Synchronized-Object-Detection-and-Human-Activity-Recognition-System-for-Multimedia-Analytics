# Synchronized-Object-Detection-and-Human-Activity-Recognition-System-for-Multimedia-Analytics

Project Description
This project focuses on creating an integrated system that combines object detection and human activity recognition for multimedia analysis. The system employs advanced models like YOLOv8 for object detection and LSTM for human activity recognition, along with a natural language processing (NLP) module to generate descriptive outputs. Designed for real-world applications such as surveillance, healthcare, and industrial automation, this system aims to improve accuracy, operational efficiency, and scene understanding.

Features
Object Detection: Real-time detection and localization of objects using YOLOv8.
